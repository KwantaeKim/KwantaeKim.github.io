If your paper isn't accepted to ISSCC and you're still a MSc or PhD student, don't be discouraged - there will be another opportunity to showcase your research at ISSCC!

IEEE ISSCC SRP as a small poster session held during the conference, where only students can present their work, though anyone is welcome to attend.

While SRP activity is not considered a formal publication, it can still boost your CV by serving as a notable achievement. If you can get the **SRP Poster award**, this is fantastic. Whenever feasible, it is always worth participating!

## Rules

Of course you can check *Call for Papers* document, but here I briefly summarize what are important rules:

- As indicated by the name of the event, **only students** are eligible to apply.
- A supervisor’s endorsement is required, and each supervisor can endorse only **one student**.
  - In accordance with the *Call for Papers*, a faculty member is considered to be eligible to endorse a student.
- Public disclosure of any part of the submitted content is not allowed.
  - As such, if the core ideas of submission have been already published elsewhere, the submission is disqualified.
  - The presenter’s name may be disclosed.

<br><br>

## Activities

If the SRP submission is accepted, the student will do the following activities:

- <span style="margin-right: 0.2em;"></span><i class="fa-solid fa-utensils fa-lg"></i><span style="margin-right: 0.2em;"></span> The dinner event with SRP winners (this is mandatory <i class="fa-regular fa-face-laugh-wink fa-lg"></i>). The dinner time will be right before the SRP session starts.
- <i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard fa-lg"></i> A 1-min short presentation of the work.
- <span style="margin-right: 2em;"><i class="fa-solid fa-scroll fa-lg"></i><span style="margin-right: 2em;"> A poster session during the event.

<br><br>

## Submission

- A 5-page slide to introduce the work
  - ex. 1 page for title, 1 page for measurement/simulation, 3 pages for circuit details, with introduction, overall architecture, and circuit details.
- A simulated work is also eligible to apply for the SRP, but having chip measurement results is always a plus.
- Note that ISSCC SRP submissions are mostly the rejected works to ISSCC, and many of them appear at VLSI Symposium, CICC, ESSERC, A-SSCC. The submission is quite competitive!

<br><br>

## Other Notes

- If you are selected as the winner of SRP Poster Award, you will be awarded at the next ISSCC (ex. you presented SRP in 2025, then you will get opportunity to be awarded in ISSCC 2026).
