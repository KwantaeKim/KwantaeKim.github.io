The **Solid-State Circuit Society (SSCS)** has been on a mission to take actions with their **Open-Source Ecosystem (OSE)** initiative. We see that the chip design community has been a bit isolated compared to the AI algorithm development side. 
<center><img src='{{ site.base_url }}{{ site.image_dir }}/barrier.gif' style='width:48%'>
<img src='{{ site.base_url }}{{ site.image_dir }}/money-count.gif' style='width:49%'></center>

The entrance <i class="fa-solid fa-road-barrier fa-lg"></i> barrier of the <i class="fa-solid fa-microchip fa-lg" style="color: black;"></i> chip design world is still high for newbies, as access to tools like **Cadence** and **Synopsys** is almost impossible for personal usage because of their license costs <i class="fa-solid fa-sack-dollar fa-lg"></i>.

<center></center>

Of course, if you're in a <i class="fa-solid fa-school-flag fa-lg"></i> university or <i class="fa-solid fa-building fa-lg"></i> company, you have access, but what if not? This **SSCS** initiative encourages people to try designing circuits using open-source tools and open-source device libraries, namely **Process Design Kit (PDK)**.

Here's the thing: if you're already a pro with **Cadence** or **Synopsys**, you're in for a treat. It is a really nice opportunity to take advantage of applying for a grant or enjoying international <i class="fa-regular fa-handshake fa-lg"></i> networking opportunities through collaborations with **Open-Source Tools**!!

<br><br>

## Regarding PDK

<center><img src='{{ site.base_url }}{{ site.image_dir }}/blog/2024-05-23-14-35-11.png' style='width:50%'></center>

Okay, let's say, you've got these fancy open-source tools. But to play around with your design **Lego**s, you need the **Lego** pieces, which is **PDK**. You might ask:

> Well, even getting these Legos is super-expensive!

For instance, obtaining a device library (or standard cell library), which can only be obtained through an **Non-Disclousre Agreement (NDA)** with a foundry like **TSMC**, raises questions about its feasibility.

Fortunately, thanks to a fantastic collaboration with <i class="fa-brands fa-google fa-lg"></i> **Google**, PDKs for `SkyWater 130nm` and `GlobalFoundries 180nm` have been made open-source up to this point.

</center>

So, having the library makes it possible to reach the tape-out-ready GDS. You can even find an <a href="https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9816083" target="_blank">SSC-L paper</a> publication with a <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-check fa-beat" style="color: #005000;"></i> **Silicon-Verified** <i class="fa-solid fa-temperature-three-quarters fa-xl" style="color: red;"></i> **Temperature Sensor** using `SkyWater 130nm` process!

## SSCS Program

**SSCS** offers various activities in this regard. There are two big ones:

- **PICO** Open-Source **Chipathon**
- **Code-a-Chip** Travel Grant Awards

led by

<a href="https://github.com/bmurmann" target="_blank">Boris Murmann</a> | <i class="fa-solid fa-school-flag fa-lg"></i> University of Hawaii
<a href="https://github.com/msaligane" target="_blank">Mehdi Saligane</a> | <i class="fa-solid fa-school-flag fa-lg"></i> University of Michigan

<br>

### PICO Chipathon

**PICO Chipathon** is a program supported by **SSCS**, taking you from tape-out to PCB creation.

If you're a student looking to make your CV fancier, I would like to suggest forming a team and participating into this. It's an **SSCS**-supported activity and even paper-worthy.

But there's a thing to note â€“ it's all about building the open-source ecosystem. You must use open-source tools and PDKs and share your <i class="fa-solid fa-microchip fa-lg"></i> chip design on <i class="fa-brands fa-github fa-lg"></i> GitHub.

<center><img src='{{ site.base_url }}{{ site.image_dir }}/team.gif' style='width:60%'></center>

Group a team of ~3 members (single-member team is also possible) and submit your proposal before the deadline, then you'll be in the review process.

Selected teams meet regularly through Zoom, sometimes get some useful circuit lectures from experts, share circuit thoughts, and work together until the tape-out deadline.

<br>

### Code-a-Chip

The **Code-a-Chip** grant applications are made with Jupyter Notebook. Jupyter Notebook is a popular <i class="fa-brands fa-python fa-lg"></i> Python editor.

The procedure is:

1. design your circuit
2. make your design runnable within the Jupyter Notebook environment
3. make your design public on <i class="fa-brands fa-github fa-lg"></i> Github
4. submit it to the grant

Prior winners were invited to:

- ***IEEE ISSCC*** in San Francisco (United States <span class='emoji'>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span>)
- ***IEEE VLSI Symposium*** in annually alternating Kyoto (Japan <span class='emoji'>ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡µ</span>) and Hawaii (United States <span class='emoji'>ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸</span>)

**SSCS** covers expenses like <i class="fa-solid fa-address-card fa-lg"></i> conference registration, <i class="fa-solid fa-plane-circle-check fa-lg"></i> flight, and <i class="fa-solid fa-bed fa-lg"></i> accommodation within specified limits.

There will be a separate session for the open-source **Code-a-Chip** <i class="fa-solid fa-person-chalkboard"></i> presentation, which means, you will get the chance to showcase your design at these <i class="fa-solid fa-medal fa-lg"></i> prestigious IEEE chip design conferences!

This is actually a very nice opportunity to add an **SSCS** award to your CV and make your profile special.

## Why do I Write This Post

Well, you might feel tricky as you encounter open-source tools for the first time.

In my case, I was merely familiar only with `Cadence Virtuoso` and what I knew about <i class="fa-brands fa-linux fa-xl"></i> Linux-related terminal commands were just a few like `cd, rm, ls`, etc.

I knew what was <i class="fa-brands fa-github fa-lg"></i> Github but didn't have a chance to use Github even until my 3rd-year Ph.D. course.

But if you want to use all of these open-source chip design tools, it is better to be familiar with <i class="fa-brands fa-git-alt fa-xl"></i> Git and terminal-based commands.

This post series is supposed to help those people like me who know little about open-source tools.
